        <h2>Insights:</h2>
        <p>&emsp;Nusa Penida is a beautiful island near Bali, and I had the chance to visit a place there called Broken Beach. It was amazing!
            <br></br>We got there by boat and then drove through the island's green hills to reach Broken Beach. When we arrived, I was stunned by the view. 
            The beach was inside a big circle of cliffs, and there was a hole in the rocks where the sea came in. The water was a bright blue color, 
            and it looked like a painting. We climbed down some steps to get to the beach. I couldn't swim there because the water was rough, 
            but I enjoyed the view and the sound of the waves hitting the cliffs. Birds flew around the cliffs, and the place felt really special. 
            We stayed for a while, took lots of pictures, and explored the area. Nearby, there was another spot called Angel's Billabong, 
            which had a beautiful natural pool with clear green water. I took a quick swim there before leaving. As the sun went down, it made the cliffs look even more beautiful. 
            Broken Beach reminded me of how amazing nature is, and I left feeling grateful for this hidden paradise.
